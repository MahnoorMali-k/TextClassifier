**Description:**

This project implements a **Naive Bayes Text Classifier** in Python, designed to classify textual data into predefined categories. The classifier leverages the **Naive Bayes algorithm**, a probabilistic machine learning approach based on Bayes' Theorem, which assumes independence between features given the class label. 

### Key Features:
1. **Text Preprocessing:**
   - Tokenization of text into words.
   - Removal of stop words to reduce noise.
   - Conversion of text to lowercase for uniformity.
   - Optional stemming or lemmatization for word normalization.

2. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Utilizes **n-grams** (e.g., unigrams, bigrams, trigrams) to capture contextual patterns and relationships between words in the text.

3. **Training the Model:**
   - Trains on labeled datasets where each text sample is associated with a category.
   - Computes prior probabilities of each class and conditional probabilities of n-grams given the class.

4. **Classification:**
   - Assigns a category to new, unseen text by calculating the posterior probabilities for each class and selecting the one with the highest probability.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Measures performance using metrics such as accuracy.

### Use Cases:
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Classify text as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Spam Detection:** Categorize emails or messages as spam or not.
- **Topic Categorization:** Automatically tag articles or documents with relevant topics.

By using **n-grams**, the classifier captures more nuanced patterns in the text, making it better suited for tasks where word combinations or sequences carry significant meaning. This project is ideal for those exploring advanced text classification techniques and can be further extended with larger datasets or additional preprocessing methods.
