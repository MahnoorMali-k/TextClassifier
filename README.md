# TextClassifier
This project implements a Naive Bayes Text Classifier in Python, designed to classify textual data into predefined categories. The classifier leverages the Naive Bayes algorithm, a probabilistic machine learning approach based on Bayes' Theorem, which assumes independence between features given the class label.
